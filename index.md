### About Me

Hi, I'm Audrey! I'm starting this blog because I just graduated college and find myself with some additional time :) I also want to document all the exciting and monotonous parts of my life!

I've tried to make websites in the past but they usually go untouched after I get too caught up in the niceties of how it looks or my writing skills. We'll see how this goes!

#### What I'm Up To

I just graduated from UW and about to start a software engineering career at Qualtrics in Seattle!!

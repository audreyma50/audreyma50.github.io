## My Post-Grad Trip to Greece (and Spain)

During the last few weeks of my college career, I experienced all sorts of emotions. As much as I wanted to make my final moments of college last, I also had an overwhelming feeling of wanting it to be over and craved some tranquility. It was probably just senioritis though. Needing much relaxation, I embarked on a two week trip to Greece and Spain with my sister! 

Throughout the fourteen days, we saw sights in Athens, Paros, Santorini, and then I travelled to Madrid on my own while she flew to London. 

### Athens Day 1

Luckily, we had no problems with our flight to Athens (except for a two hour delay) and arrived safely. The first thing we did was shower. It was only 7pm but we were both growing tired after a long flight and headed out to Ella Greek Cooking for a quick and delicious dinner.

Despite both being tired, we couldn't really sleep the first night. Luckily, that somehow made waking up at 7AM was a lot easier. Heading to the Acropolis at 8am, we originally started listening to every audio description for every site leading up to the Parthenon. Don't do that. Unless you want to spend hours there! As a growing number of crowds started passing us, we instantly realized that we needed to head to the top before it got too crowded and hot.

I will now take some time to share how basic we dressed that day. With our exercise dresses and my Lululemon fanny pack, there was not a moment where we didn't pass other girls with some sort of variation of our same outfit.

After the Acropolis, we headed to the air conditioned Acropolis Musueum, ate lunch at their cafe, and visited other sites such as The Temple of Olympian Zeus, Hadrian's library, Kerameikos (don't really recommend), and the Ancient Agora. 

By this time, it was already 4pm and we were dealing with heat exhaustion so we headed back to our apartment and each took a nap on the couch. 

We finished the evening "hiking" up Filopappou Hill for a beautiful sunset (highly recommend!!!)

### Athens Day 2
We started off the day climbing Mount Lycabettus at 8am! It's about an easy 15 minute hike and the views are magnificent! To be honest, most of our hike was getting to the trailhead. 

Then we headed to The Clumsies...for brunch! Their Aegean Negroni was voted best cocktail in 2019 so of course I had to get it. I didn't know what a Negroni was before this but I don't think I'll be getting it again. Otherwise, the food hit and the ambiance was quite calm at least during the day time! 

### Paros
Paros was a much needed break after all the running around in Athens. Pretty much the biggest things to do here is to just chill at the beach...so that's what we did!

#### Day 1
We headed to Naoussa during the evening for dinner
